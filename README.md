# SimKLearn
Simon Kit Learn (Or SimKLearn) is my own implementations of machine learning algorithms I have used and encountered throughout college and personal projects

# Disclaimer
This library is heavily inspired by SKLearn, but is not the same. It is a simplified version for my own personal use that fits my quirks
