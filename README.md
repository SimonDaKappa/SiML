# SiML
Simon Machine Learning  (Or SiML) is my own implementations of machine learning algorithms I have used and encountered throughout college and personal projects

## Currently implementing mostly supervised learning algorithms, but plan to include reinforcement and unsupervised in due time.

# Disclaimer
This library is heavily inspired by SKLearn, but is not the same. It is a simplified version for my own personal use that fits my quirks
